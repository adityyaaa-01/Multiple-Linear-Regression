# Multiple Linear Regression - Salary Prediction

This project demonstrates the use of **Multiple Linear Regression** to predict an employee's **salary** based on their **years of experience** and **age**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Columns**:
  - `YearsExperience`: Number of years the employee has worked
  - `Age`: Age of the employee
  - `Salary`: Salary of the employee (target)

## ðŸš€ What I did

- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Checked for missing values
- Built and trained a multiple regression model using `scikit-learn`
- Visualized the regression surface in 3D
- Evaluated model using RÂ² score

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## ðŸ“ˆ Result

The model learns the relationship between features (experience, age) and salary, allowing predictions for unseen data. A 3D plot shows the regression plane fitted to the data.
